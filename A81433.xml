            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <speaker>Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>WEll met Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> You have a fair Army here.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Booth.</speaker>
               <p>O Sir <hi>John Presbyter,</hi> my good Friend, I am very glad to ſee you here; and as for Our Army, we give you many thanks: it ought more properly to be called Your Army, then ours; for we know, that by your meanes it's raiſed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed we have done our utmoſt, both by preaching, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at our ſeveral meetings (eſpecially in our private Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to carry on this deſign.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Booth.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, We are very ſenſible of your great care and pains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: I know my Maſter the King, will not let you go unrewarded.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>O Sir! That he were upon the Throne of his Father <hi>David,</hi> that was lately murdered by the wicked Sectaries! And if we ſhall let them ſtill go on, they will deſtroy us, as they have done him: that's a true Maxim, <hi>No King, no Biſhop; No Presbyter, no Parſon; No Vicar, no Curate.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Booth.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, we are much troubled at theſe times; for we fear that the Sectaries will ruine us all, you ſee they have deprived us of our good Prayer-Book, our Divine-Service; yea, our very Sacraments, as in all our publique meetings.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>Oh! We little thought once, to have ſeen ſuch a day of black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon this Nation; for we thought, that when once the Biſhops had been down, we ſhould have come in their places: otherwiſe we ſhould not, either have preached, or prayed them down.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Booth.</speaker>
               <p>I hope you and your Brethren, have ſeen your error, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

inſtrumental, for the pulling down the Fathers of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and that in this day, you ſhew your repentance, in that you do your beſt endeavour to bring in, <hi>Statu quo,</hi> things as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

               <p>We have done what we can, to the hazard of our lives, and ſtill ſhall do to the uttermoſt of our power.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Booth.</speaker>
               <p>But put the caſe, we put by this Army &amp; that it ſhould be the Kings pleaſure, to put you in the ſtead of the Holy Fathers of the Church: pray what ſhould be your firſt work, you would do for us, who indeed are your elder Brethren?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>The firſt thing we would do, if ever we have power in our hands, it ſhall be to rout out all the Sectaries in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>I, with all my heart. In the general, they are thoſe which cry down Magiſtracy and Miniſtry: ſuch as will not keep their Pariſh-Churches, but run into holes and corners.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Booth.</speaker>
               <p>Is there no honeſt men, that go ſometimes into private meetings? for I remember, my Father hath had many Miniſters and others, at his Houſe, which were looked upon for very honeſt men, by all the Cou trey.</p>

               <speaker>Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>O My dear Brother <hi>Booth,</hi> I am very ſorry to ſee you in your Enemies hands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Booth.</speaker>
               <p>I may thank you for it, for you know, I had never underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this Warr but for you; You told me, the Cauſe was good, and you would ſay your prayers for me: but now I know by woful Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience your Prayers are worth nothing, and your Curſing of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as much: I wiſh, you are not of the ſeed of <hi>Baalam,</hi> that the more you Curſe a People, the more they are Bleſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>O patience, good Brother <hi>Booth!</hi> whatever you do, have a reverend eſteem of the Clergy, or you will turn Sectary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Booth.</speaker>
               <p>Patience! I have need of patience, indeed: for all my Eſtate will be Sequeſtred, my Wife and Children undone, and I ſhall loſe my Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, I am very ſorry, but the fault is your own, and not mine, as you are pleaſed to ſay; For I did never intend that you ſhould have followed our direction, further then your own ſafety; you were too heady, and you did want diſcretion; otherwiſe you might have been at Liberty, as well as I.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Booth.</speaker>
               <p>Is this all the Comfort I am like to have from you in my Diſtreſſe? Pray what ſhould I have done more then I have? wherein am I heady, and wherein have I forfeited my diſcretion, unleſſe it were in following you, and dancing after your pipe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you again, that policy is better then ſtrength; and doing things in the nick of time, would have freed you from this trouble you are now fallen into; you are much too blame.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Booth.</speaker>
               <p>What ſhould I have done more then I did, I am ſure I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed 100000 l. to carry on this buſineſſe, and I rode far and near
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168695:4"/>
to make Confederates: and I left no means unattempted for the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this deſign: And now muſt I be blamed by you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>Come, I will tell you what you ſhould have done: and 'pray, obſerve it well.</p>
               <p>When you had received certain Intelligence of the ſtrength of your Enemies, you ſhould have preſently looked after ſelf-preſervation; you ſhould immediately with two or three of your Servants have gone and met the Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> with this Congratulation, or the like:</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am very glad that you are come into my Country, for I ſaw that the People were ſo Malignant, that I thought it was my beſt way to Head them, that ſo I might keep them from their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and in ſo doing, I could not do better Service for my Country, the Parliament, and your Lordſhip; for I feared that ſome deſperate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier would have Headed them, and then it might have proved a new War; and not onely ſo, but have done much hurt to the moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious and Religious People of this Nation. And now I ſhall do my beſt to deliver this Army into your hands; alſo give you the Names of the firſt fomen ers of this wicked Rebellion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Booth.</speaker>
               <p>But in ſo doing, I ſhould have ſpoken againſt Conſcience, and been looked upon as a Traytor, which would have been worſe than any thing that ever befell me in my Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>I can but wonder at you: What a piece of buſineſſe that is? Its as ordinary for us Clergy-men to ſpeak againſt Conſcience, as to drink. And as for your being accounted a Traytor, Which had it been beſt? To have been accounted a Traytor, and enjoyed your Eſtate, Family and Life, than to be accounted ſo now, and loſe all?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Booth.</speaker>
               <p>But, What did you do to get off ſo well, and have your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſeeing you were as deep as I?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>As ſoon as I heard that the Army was ſo great, and ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Marched into the Country, I and my Brethren faced about, and ſeemed to be for them, and when they were paſt us, we gave out that, if we had known of their coming, we would have attended upon his Lordſhip and the Army; and not onely ſo, but we put it into the weekly Intelligence, ſhewing our good affection to their party: ſo that we are not ſo much as queſtioned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Booth.</speaker>
               <p>But, Is not this Diſſimulation and Equivocation? How ſhall I know what to believe when I hear you Preach?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>If you would know what I mean when I preach, you muſt look upon my actions, and not my words, unleſs it be in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:168695:5"/>1. When we preach for our Tythes and maintenance. 2. When we cry down the Sectaries. 3. When we would change a ſmall Living for a greater. 4.
